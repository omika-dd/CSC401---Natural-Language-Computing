Discussion on difference from section 3.2:

Not sure if we did this correctly as we got the same accuracy values for all classifiers.
We also got the same accuracy values for all classifiers for section 4 and section 3.2.
We had imagined to see the accuracy value increase as the n increased because there was a larger
data set to train on, and therefore improved accuracy.

We found this strange and it was not what we expected.

If they are the correct values, then I was surprised to see that they remained the same
as n increased. As for the reason they are the same as the WEKA classifier in sec 3.2,
we guess that the NLC classifier and the WEKA classifier work similarly and run on
similar algorithms.
