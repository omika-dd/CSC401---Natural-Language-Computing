REPORT:
From these results, it is apparent that the reduction of parameter values
significantly decreases the proportion of correct classifications. In comparison
to using the full training data set, these numbers are all â‰¤ 0.1, which is less
than a quarter of the proportion of using the default parameter settings.
This may also have to do with the fact that we used 7 EM iterations for part 3.1,
and only 3 EM iterations for these experiments.

Not surprisingly,
The smallest value (9th experiment) comes from using the smallest parameters.
The largest value (12th experiment) comes from using the largest parameters.

Increasing the number of states per sequence to 3 from 2 makes a big difference
in the power of the mixture value. It takes the difference from 2.6x to 1. The
proportion is the same when using 3 hidden states despite the change in mixtures.

Decreasing the number of mixtures always produces a lower correct classification
value. Increasing from 1 to 2 makes a large difference between the range of no
difference to 2.6x the proportion value.

Decreasing the number of states per sequence from 3 to 2 does not make such a
significant difference. In 2 cases, there is no difference when changing the
states from 3 to 2. This is when mix = 2, 2, training = 5, 5, and dimensions =
2, 7. Usually, using 2 states per sequence yields a lower correct ratio, but
not in all cases. This is the case when mix = 2, training = 7, and dimension = 2.
This suggests that the 2-state HMM provided less detail and was therefore easier
to classify correctly among the data.

Changing the number of training folders from 5 to 7 does not usually yield a
big difference in correct classifications. However there are some special cases.
When # mixtures is very low, (1) it skews the proportion by much larger factors
with respect to amount of training data. Usually, using 5 folders results in a
lower proportion, meaning less accuracy, however in the case when the mix = 1,
states = 3, and dimension = 2, the proportion is higher using 5 folders. This
demonstrates the strong power of the mixture value, and perhaps also the combination
of a low dimension and 3-state HMM.

The decrease in dimension value always produces a lower proportion. The smallest
difference however, is when amount of training data is low (5), mixtures is low
(1), and states is relatively higher (3). This is when dimension has the least
impact.

Conclusion:
Using 3 states usually balances out the other factors. Despite a change in the
rest of the parameters, there is not so large of a difference when using 3 hidden
states. Mixture value has the most power in changing the accuracy values. The
decrease in training data from 7 to 5 almost always produces a decrease in
proportion, but not by a significant enough amount. The dimension value going from
7 to 2 also make quite a large difference--the accuracy when using 7 compared to
2 usually results around 2x the proportion value.
